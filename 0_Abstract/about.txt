                              DOOR SENSOR
The door sensor is an essential component used in-home security system. The designing of these sensors can be done with two parts which are arranged in parallel to each other. So that the circuit can be formed. When someone tries to open the door then these parts will get separated and breaks the circuit. So the control panel will activate to light up the led. These sensors are very easy to install and portable. 
The door sensors come with two pieces a reed switch as well as a magnet. Here the read switch is connected to the door and magnet is arranged to parallel to the switch. So that closed-circuit can be formed when the door is closed. When the door gets open, the switch and the magnet will separate to break the circuit. So the sensor gives an indication to the control panel to generate an alarm.
